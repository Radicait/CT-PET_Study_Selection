You are given a radiology report from a diagnostic CT-only study. Extract the data below and output a STRICT JSON object only (no extra text).

# 1. CT Regions
List regions scanned in this CT report. Use only these labels:
- head/brain
- chest/lung
- neck
- pelvis
- abdomen

Format:
"CT_Regions": ["chest/lung", ...]

# 2. CT Contrast Agent
If the report indicates non-contrast, use "None". If contrast was used, use "Iodine" (do not guess a brand name).
Format:
"CT_Contrast_Agent": "None" or "Iodine"

# 3. Lung Nodules
Extract all nodules mentioned in the lung region. For each nodule, include:
- size_mm: numeric size in mm (convert from cm to mm if needed)
- location: one of {"right upper lobe","right middle lobe","right lower lobe","left upper lobe","left lower lobe"} or ""
- Slice_number: if explicitly mentioned, else ""

Format:
"Lung_Nodules": [
  {"size_mm":"","location":"","Slice_number":""}
]

# Output JSON schema (exact keys only):
{
  "CT_Regions": [],
  "CT_Contrast_Agent": "",
  "Lung_Nodules": [
    {"size_mm":"","location":"","Slice_number":""}
  ]
}

Rules:
- Output ONLY valid JSON.
- Use empty arrays/strings if not present.
